# FLAN-T5 Text Generation Demo

This project demonstrates text generation using Google's FLAN-T5 model
via prompt-based inference.

## Model
- google/flan-t5-base
- Hugging Face Transformers

## Example

Prompt:
Explain what machine learning is in simple words for a beginner.

Output:
Machine learning is a process that learns information from a computer program.

## Observations
The model generates different explanations depending on the prompt,
demonstrating prompt sensitivity and language understanding.

## Use Cases
- NLP prototyping
- Prompt engineering practice
- Lightweight text generation demos
